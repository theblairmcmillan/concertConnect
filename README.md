# concertConnect
Final capstone project for NSS

# Synopsis 

Concert Connect is an aplication that allows traveling musicians to connect with the growing network of people across the United States that frequently host house concerts.
Musicians and hosts are able to create there own profile and browse other users profiles and contact each other through the application. 


# Motivation

As a musician myself I always wished I had an app that would let me know if there was a potential house concert in the area I would be traveling, So I built this app to allow that to happen. 

# Technologies
